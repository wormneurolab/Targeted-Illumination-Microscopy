In widefield fluorescence imaging, out-of-focus and scattered light from the bright cell body often obscure nearby dim fibers and degrade their contrast. Scanning techniques can solve this problem but are limited by reduced imaging speed and increased cost. We greatly reduce stray light in widefield imaging by modulating the illumination intensity to different structures. We identify fibers by real-time iterated image processing, and target illumination to fibers by a digital micromirror device add-on to a common widefield microscope. We illuminate bright cell bodies with minimal light intensity and in-focus fibers with high light intensity. This procedure minimizes the background and enhances the visibility of fibers while maintaining a fast-imaging speed and low cost. Using this targeted illumination approach, we demonstrate confocal quality imaging of complex neurons in anesthetized C. elegans, ex vivo mouse brain slice, and restrained zebrafish larva.
